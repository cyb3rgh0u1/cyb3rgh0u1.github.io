Hey, I'm CyberGhoul!

A CTF junkie, a cybersecurity nerd and a researcher who’s always digging around for something new to learn. I use Arch (yep, I’m that guy, BTW :)) and I’m one of the developers behind [**HyDe**](https://github.com/HyDE-Project). I spend way too much time messing with Hyprland setups because I’m obsessed with theming. Oh, and I love hacking stuff—legally, of course! This site’s my playground, so hang out and let’s crack some flags together.
